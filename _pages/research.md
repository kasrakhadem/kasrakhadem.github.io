with G. Kosmopoulou, S. Connely, Y. Gujar, M. Fichtel, and H. Sun <br>
<i>Southern Economic Journal, 90, 1 2023, 31-34.</i>
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p align="justify">We explore how technology use helped to cope with the stresses of social distancing during the pandemic contributing insights about the impact of work adaptation enabled by technology on economic vulnerability and resilience. Using a three-wave survey conducted across 10 states in the United States, we found evidence that a high level of technology use was linked to a greater chance of maintaining employment during the pandemic. We evaluate job retention as a function of an index based on the prevalence of information technology (IT) usage in the workplace and psychological and somatic well-being, controlling for technology use outside of the workplace, and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.</p>

with Georgia Kosmopoulou and Carlos Lamarche
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p align="justify" >In recent years, CryptoArt prices have surged to levels typically associated with renowned artists' works, a phenomenon both puzzling and understudied. This paper investigates how trading networks and platform connections influence prices in the digital art marketplace hosted on an online platform. We find that larger seller trading networks lead to higher auction prices for lower priced digital art, while platform connections play a critical role, especially for the most expensive pieces.  Our research underscores that in decentralized online markets, the power to set prices rests with trading networks and platform connections, with differential impact across the distribution of prices.</p>

<b>Network Dynamics in The US Airline Industry</b><br>
with Lei He, Myongjin Kim, and Georgia Kosmopoulou
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p align="justify">We study the evolution of subcontracting networks of airline carriers in the U.S. and the effect of COVID-19 on competition and cooperative behaviors in the airline industry. We show how shelter-in-place restrictions during the pandemic affected the market and altered the subcontracting networks of airlines. Using Bayesian estimation, we find the probability of link formation based on the rivals' network, past relationships, and types of service. Additionally, we examine the impact of shelter-in-place restrictions on the market exit decisions of regional airlines.</p>

<b>Airline Route Networks and Subcontracting in the Pandemic Era</b><br>
with Lei He, Myongjin Kim, Georgia Kosmopoulou, and Qihong Liu
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p align="justify">We investigate the route network decisions made by airline carriers in the United States and the impact of pandemic-related restrictions on these networks. Our modeling approach enables us to examine airlines' decisions regarding the complete route network, instead of focusing on route choices at the market level. We estimate the likelihood of selecting a route network based on the past network, network of competitors, and characteristics of the routes.</p>
